  - For easier use right click the clean.ps1 file and send it to desktop as a shortcut

Run Instructions :
  - Double click the clean.ps1 (or the shortcut ) and all files in the selected clean folder(s)
    will be sent to a sub folder in your target folder
    Note : the sub folders in the cleanup folder are based on file extensions
           these subfolders are created automagically if they don't exist
